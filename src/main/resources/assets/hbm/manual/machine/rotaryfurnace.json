		"en_us": "A type of alloying furnace that can accept multiple item inputs and a fluid and output the result as liquid metal which needs to be cast. Used to make [[weapon steel|Weapon Steel]] and [[saturnite|Saturnite]], and features alternate recipes for [[gunmetal|Gunmetal]] and [[steel|Steel]]. Requires both a solid fuel and [[steam|Steam]] to function, creating [[low-pressure steam|Low-Pressure Steam]] in the process.<br><br>Items can be inserted from the color-coded access points in the back. The input fluid can only be connected to one of the two grey ports on the output side. Steam and low-pressure steam ducts need to be connected to the steam engine on the left. Solid fuel can be inserted through the iron bars at the front. Exhaust smoke can be extracted from the opening at the top, the furnace will emit a smoke plume if not connected to a smoke stack.",
