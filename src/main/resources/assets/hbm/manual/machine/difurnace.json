		"en_us": "Simple furnace that can combine two items into one output, usually in the form of an alloy. Needed early on as the first source of [[steel|Steel]], [[red copper|Minecraft Grade Copper]] and [[advanced alloy|Advanced Alloy]]. Does not accept all furnace fuels, only works with hot burning ones like coal, coke or lava buckets. Can be accelerated by placing a blast furnace extension on top, which also makes it more efficient.",
